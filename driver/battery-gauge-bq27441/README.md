This class provides APIs to all of the registers of the TI BQ27441 battery gauge.

The caller should instantiate an I2C interface and pass this to init(), which will initialise the chip and place it into its lowest power state.  Battery gauging is enabled separately.  When battery gauging is enabled, the remaining capacity can be determined using the getRemainingCapacity()/getRemainingPercentage() API calls and the API calls to return voltage, current and temperature will return the last reading taken.  When battery gauging is disabled the chip will be maintained in its lowest power state until a voltage/current/temperature reading is requested, whereupon it will wake up, make an ADC reading and then return to sleep, taking ~1 seconds to take the reading.

All of the API calls are able to work with a SEALED or UNSEALED chip, provided that the correct unseal code is given to the init() function if it differs from the default.
